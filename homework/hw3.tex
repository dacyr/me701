Instructions:  Your solutions to the following should be contained in
one file named {\tt lastname\_firstname\_hw3.py} and uploaded to Canvas.


\section*{Problem 1 -- Some Python \texttt{str} Basics}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let \texttt{a = ``hello''} and \texttt{b = ``world''}.  Use 
      \texttt{a} and  \texttt{b} to produce \texttt{c = ``hello world''}.
\item Figure out how to define \texttt{d = ``Hello World''} starting with 
      \texttt{c}.
\item From \texttt{d}, define \texttt{e = ``Hello''} and  \texttt{f = ``World''}
      in a single line of code.
\item Let  \texttt{g = 123; h = 3.141592653589793; i = 6.022e23}.  Using those 
      values, produce \\ \texttt{j = '123|3.1416| 6.02e+23'} in just one line.
\item Let \texttt{k = 5} (or some other integer).  Use that to produce 
      \texttt{l =  '0..1..2..3..4'} in just one line.
\end{enumerate} 

\section*{Problem 2 -- A Python Oddity}

Consider the following code and output
\begin{verbatim}
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> a[0] = 99
>>> a
[99, 2, 3]
>>> b
[99, 2, 3]
\end{verbatim}
In other words, a change in \texttt{a} leads to
a change in \texttt{b}.  This can confuse Python
newbies.  
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Explain, in your own words, why this happens.
 \item Offer {\bf two} ways by which one could 
       produce a second list \texttt{b} with the same 
       values as \texttt{a}.  At least {\bf one} of 
       these should require no more than one 
       expression.  For reference, an expression is 
       just a composition of arithmetic or other operations, e.g.,
       \texttt{sin(a**2)/4.0+1}.
\end{enumerate}



\section*{Problem 3 -- List Comprehension}

List comprehension is a uniquely Pythonic way to construct lists
without using explicit loops.  Rewrite the following using list 
comprehension:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item 
  \begin{lstlisting}
  # compute first 20 powers of 2
  i = 0
  powers = []
  while i < 20:
      p = 2 ** i
      powers.append(p)
      i = i + 1
  \end{lstlisting}
 \item 
  \begin{lstlisting}
  # Generate all (x, y, z) coordinates from three lists
  xpoints = [1, 2, -1]
  ypoints = [8, 4, 3, 0]
  zpoints = [0, -1]
  points = []
  for x in xpoints:
      for y in ypoints:
	        for z in zpoints:
	            points.append((x, y, z))
  \end{lstlisting}
  
\end{enumerate}
  
\section*{Problem 4 -- Binary Fun}

In class, we covered some basics of floating-point numbers, showing,
for example, that $0.1$ (in base-10) can only be represented 
in the base-2 (binary) system using an infinite number of bits.
In other words, $0.1$ cannot be represented on our computers.  Your 
job is to write a function that computes the closest binary
representation of a given base-10 number using a fixed number of 
bits for the fractional part (i.e., the stuff to the right of 
the floating point).  In essence, you are extending 
the built-in {\tt bin} function. \\

{\bf Deliverables}:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Implement a function named {\tt decimal\_to\_binary(x, n)} 
       that accepts a floating-point number $n$ and an integer 
       $n$, and returns the binary representation of that 
       number using at most $n$ bits to the right of the 
       floating point.  For simplicity, return the 
       result as a string.  Example: for $x = 123.625_{10}$ and $n = 4$, you 
       should return {\tt '1111011.1010'}. 
 \item Implement a second function {\tt binary\_to\_decimal(i, f)} that 
       takes a binary number of the form  {\tt '1111011.1010'} and returns
       it in base-10 as a standard float.  
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 5 -- Conservation of Numbers?}

Summing up the elements of an array is easy:
\begin{lstlisting}
# option 1
s = 0   
for i in range(len(a)):
   s += a[i]
\end{lstlisting}
However, one could also do this:
\begin{lstlisting}
# option 2
s = 0   
a = sorted(a)
for i in range(len(a)):
   s += a[i]
\end{lstlisting}
Or even this:
\begin{lstlisting}
# option 3
def sumr(a):
    if len(a) <= 2:
        return sum(a)
    else:
        return sumr(a[:len(a)//2]) + sumr(a[len(a)//2:])
s = sumr(a)
\end{lstlisting}
By using {\tt a = np.random.rand(n)} and the {\tt Decimal} module, perform a numerical experiment that shows (1) which of these approaches is most accurate, (2) how these compare to the built-in {\tt sum} and {\tt np.sum} functions, and (3) how the error in the sum varies with the number of elements {\tt n} of the array {\tt a} being summed. \\

I hope that this problem highlights a basic fact: even the simplest of numerical computing tasks results in observable error!
